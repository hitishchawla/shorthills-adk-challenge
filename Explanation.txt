Architecture Explanation:

This project implements a modular multi-agent architecture inspired by Google ADK design principles. A Root Orchestrator coordinates three specialized sub-agents: ResearchAgent, MarketAgent, and StrategyAgent. Each agent performs a distinct responsibility in a sequential execution pattern. The system is structured to integrate ADK’s built-in google_search tool and custom tools such as report generation and competitive analysis. Outputs are aggregated into a structured JSON report for scalability and extensibility. The design emphasizes modularity, clear separation of concerns, and orchestration logic. The architecture can be extended by directly integrating Gemini models and ADK tooling for real-time web intelligence and autonomous agent collaboration.
